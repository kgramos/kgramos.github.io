<h1>Hello, my name is Karla!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my first self-made website!</h2>

<p1><strong>A little bit about me... I am a first-year student in the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born and raised in El Paso, TX. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and have working knowledge of French. Some of my favorite past-times include yoga, travelling, and photogrpahy. I consider myself to be an adventuorus free spirit. </strong></p1>
